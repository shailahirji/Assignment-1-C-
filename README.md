Phonebook App, implementing friend function and operator overloading 
This repository consists of a Phonebook App that allows a user to add, delete, search and list contact details that are within the phonebook. 
The goal of this assignment was to better understand the syntax used in C++ thus, there is very limited focus on efficiency for this project. 
The project could have been made more efficient by using linked lists or Array lists as data structures.
